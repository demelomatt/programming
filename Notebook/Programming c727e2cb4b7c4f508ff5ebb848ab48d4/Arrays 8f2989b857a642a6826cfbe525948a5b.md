# Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure, and they are extremely useful. We use arrays to hold values of the same type at contiguous memory locations. In particular, the use of arrays allows us to create "groups" or "clusters" of variables without needing to give a unique variable name to each, but still allowing us to individually index into the elements of the array.

In C, arrays are zero-indexed which means the first element of a k-element array is located at array index 0 and the last element is located at array index k-1.
