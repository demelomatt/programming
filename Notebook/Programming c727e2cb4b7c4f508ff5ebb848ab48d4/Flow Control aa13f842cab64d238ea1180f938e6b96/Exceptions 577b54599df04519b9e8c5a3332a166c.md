# Exceptions

It's very rare that a large program or software works correctly the first time. It might have errors.

Programmers can debug these errors by exhausting debugging and testing procedures. But programmers often come across some peculiar problems in addition logic or syntax errors. These types of errors are known as exceptions. 

Exceptions are run-time anomalies or unusual logical conditions that may come up while executing a program. Exceptions allow a method to react to exceptional circumstances and errors (like runtime errors) within programs by transferring control to special functions called handlers.

**There are two types of exceptions:**

1. Synchronous exceptions
2. Asynchronous exceptions

Errors such as: out of range index and overflow fall under the category of *synchronous* type exceptions. 

Those errors that are caused by events beyond the control of the program are called *asynchronous* exceptions. 

The main motive of the exceptional handling concept is to provide a means to detect and report an exception so that appropriate action can be taken. 

**This mechanism needs a separate error handling code that performs the following tasks:**

- Find and hit the problem (exception)
- Inform that the error has occurred (throw exception)
- Receive the error information (Catch the exception)
- Take corrective actions (handle exception)

Exception handling in C++ is built on three keywords: ***try***, ***catch***, and ***throw***.

- **try**
- **throw:** A program throws an exception when a problem is detected which is done using a keyword "throw".
- **catch:** A program catches an exception with an exception handler where
programmers want to handle the anomaly. The keyword catch is used for
catching exceptions.

### Syntax:

```cpp
try
{
    throw exception;
}

catch(type arg)
{
    //some code
}
```

If the try block throws an exception then program control leaves the block and enters into the catch statement of the catch block. If the type of object thrown matches the argument type in the catch statement, the catch block is executed for handling the exception. Divided-by-zero is a common form of exception generally occurred in arithmetic based programs.

### Example:

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

double division(int var1, int var2)
{
    if (var2 == 0) {
        throw "Division by Zero.";
    }
    return (var1 / var2);
}

int main()
{
    int a = 30;
    int b = 0;
    double d = 0;

    try {
        d = division(a, b);
        cout << d << endl;
    }
    catch (const char* error) {
        cout << error << endl;
    }
```
