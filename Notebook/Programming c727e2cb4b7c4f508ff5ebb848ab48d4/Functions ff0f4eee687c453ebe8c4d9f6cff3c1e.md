# Functions

We can control the flow of a program by calling a function. If we  call a function, it executes, returns a value, and then resumes the program where it was called. Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reuse.

In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task is called a function. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.

Most programming languages come with a prewritten set of functions that are kept in a library. You can also write your own functions to perform specialized tasks.
