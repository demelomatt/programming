# Standard library functions

The standard library functions are built-in functions in programming.

The standard library functions are optimized for performance and it saves considerable development time

These functions in C are defined in header files. For example,

- The `printf()` is a standard library function to sendformatted output to the screen (display output on the screen). This function is defined in the `stdio.h` header file. Hence, to use the `printf()` function, we need to include the `stdio.h` header file using `#include <stdio.h>`.
- The `sqrt()` function calculates the square root of a number. The function is defined in the `math.h` header file.
