# Introduction

What is computer science?

- Computer science is fundamentally problem solving.
- We can think of **problem solving** as the process of taking some input (details about our problem) and generate some output (the solution to our problem). The “black box” in
the middle is computer science, or the code we’ll learn to write.

The black box will contain algorithms, step-by-step instructions for solving problems

Humans can follow algorithms too, such as recipes for cooking. When programming a computer, we need to be more precise with our algorithms so our instructions aren’t ambiguous or misinterpreted.

When we write programs using algorithms, we generally care not just how correct they are, but how well-designed they are, considering factors such as efficiency.

- When writing code, we might consider the following qualities:
    - **Correctness**, or whether our code works correctly, as intended.
    - **Design**, or a subjective measure of how well-written our code is, based on how
    efficient it is and how elegant or logically readable it is, without
    unnecessary repetition.
    - **Style**, or how aesthetically formatted our code is, in terms of consistent
    indentation and other placement of symbols. Differences in style don’t
    affect the correctness or meaning of our code, but affect how readable
    it is visually.
