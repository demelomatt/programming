# Constants

If you want to define a variable whose value cannot be changed, you can use theÂ `const` keyword. This will create a constant. For example,

```c
const double PI = 3.14;
```

Here, PI is a symbolic constant; its value cannot be changed.

```c
const double PI = 3.14;
PI = 2.9; //Error
```
