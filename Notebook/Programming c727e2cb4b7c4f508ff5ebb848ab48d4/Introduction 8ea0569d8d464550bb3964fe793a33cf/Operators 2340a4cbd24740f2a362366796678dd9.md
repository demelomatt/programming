# Operators

An operator is a symbol that operates on a value or a variable. For example: + is an operator to perform addition.

[C Arithmetic Operators](Operators%202340a4cbd24740f2a362366796678dd9/C%20Arithmetic%20Operators%209f934e91629f432fbb367a2bde3da4be.csv)

An arithmetic operator performs mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division etc on numerical values (constants and variables).

Example:

```c
// Working of arithmetic operators
#include <stdio.h>int main()
{
    int a = 9,b = 4, c;
    
    c = a+b;
    printf("a+b = %d \n",c);
    c = a-b;
    printf("a-b = %d \n",c);
    c = a*b;
    printf("a*b = %d \n",c);
    c = a/b;
    printf("a/b = %d \n",c);
    c = a%b;
    printf("Remainder when a divided by b = %d \n",c);
    
    return 0;
}
```

In normal calculation, `9/4 = 2.25`. However, the output is `2` in the program.

It is because both the variables a and b are integers. 
Hence, the output is also an integer. The compiler neglects the term after the decimal point and shows answer `2` instead of `2.25`.

The modulo operator % computes the remainder. When a=9 is divided by b=4, the remainder is 1. The % operator can only be used with integers.

[C Assignment Operators](Operators%202340a4cbd24740f2a362366796678dd9/C%20Assignment%20Operators%20bea13b55a31143d793302448a1c0b9aa.csv)

An assignment operator is used for assigning a value to a variable. The most common assignment operator is `=`

[C Relational Operators](Operators%202340a4cbd24740f2a362366796678dd9/C%20Relational%20Operators%2065a086c26e29495aa753dde07b553867.csv)

A relational operator checks the relationship between two operands. 
If the relation is true, it returns 1; if the relation is false, it 
returns value 0.

[C Logical Operators](Operators%202340a4cbd24740f2a362366796678dd9/C%20Logical%20Operators%20e8596e29fe014d3f96f6e86822f58af4.csv)

An expression containing logical operator returns either 0 or 1 depending upon whether expression results true or false.
