# Escape Sequences/Special Symbols

# Escape Sequences

Sometimes, it is necessary to use characters that cannot be typed or 
has special meaning in C programming. For example: newline(enter), tab, question mark etc.

In order to use these characters, escape sequences are used.

For example: `\n` is used for a newline. The backslash `\` causes escape from the normal way the characters are handled by the compiler.

# Special Symbols

The following special symbols are used in C having some special meaning and thus, cannot be used for some other purpose.

- **Brackets[]:** Opening and closing brackets are used as array element reference. These indicate single and multidimensional subscripts.
- **Parentheses():** These special symbols are used to indicate function calls and function parameters.
- **Braces{}:** These opening and ending curly braces mark the start and end of a block of code containing more than one executable statement.
- **Comma (, ):** It is used to separate more than one statements like for separating parameters in function calls.
- **Colon(:):** It is an operator that essentially invokes something called an initialization list.
- **Semicolon(;):** It is known as a statement terminator. It indicates the end of one logical entity. That’s why each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon.
- **Asterisk (*):** It is used to create a pointer variable.
- **Assignment operator(=):** It is used to assign values.
- **Pre-processor (#):** The preprocessor is a macro processor that is used automatically by the compiler to transform your program before actual compilation.
