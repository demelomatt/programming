# Single-line comment

Escape Sequences: //

Comments are hints that a programmer can add to make their code easier to read and understand. 

Comments are very important while writing a program. They are completely ignored by compilers.

They describe what is going on inside a program, so that a person looking at the source code does not have a hard time figuring it out.

You might forget the key details of the program you just wrote in a month's time. So taking the time to explain these concepts in the form of comments is always fruitful.

In C, any line that starts with `//` is a comment. For example:

```c
// declaring a variable
int a;

// initializing the variable 'a' with the value 2
a = 2;

```

Here, we have used two single-line comments:

- `// declaring a variable`
- `// initializing the variable 'a' with the value 2`

We can also use single line comment like this:

```c
int a;    // declaring a variable
```
