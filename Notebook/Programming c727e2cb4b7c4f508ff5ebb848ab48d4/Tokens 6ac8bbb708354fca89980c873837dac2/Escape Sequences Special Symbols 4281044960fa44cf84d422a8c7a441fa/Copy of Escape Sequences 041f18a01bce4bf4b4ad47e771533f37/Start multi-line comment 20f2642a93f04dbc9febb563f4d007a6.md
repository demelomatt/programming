# Start multi-line comment

Escape Sequences: /*

In C, any line between `/*` and `*/` is also a comment. For example:

```c
/* declaring a variable
to store salary to employees
*/
int salary = 2000;

```

This syntax can be used to write both single-line and multi-line comments.

**Note:** Comments shouldn't be the substitute for a way to explain poorly written code in English. We should always write well-structured and self-explanatory code. And, then use comments. As a general rule of thumb, use comments to explain **Why** you did something rather than **How** you did something, and you are good.
