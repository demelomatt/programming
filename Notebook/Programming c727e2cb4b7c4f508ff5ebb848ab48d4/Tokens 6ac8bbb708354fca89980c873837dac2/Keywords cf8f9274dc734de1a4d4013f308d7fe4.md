# Keywords

Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler. Keywords are part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an identifier. For example:

```c
int money;
```

Here, `int` is a keyword that indicates moneyÂ is a variable of type `int` (integer).

As C is a case sensitive language, all keywords must be written in lowercase.
